# Pleiades Frontend

## Setup

Create the .env file based on the .env.example file. Rerun `npm run dev` so that svelte regenerates the environment variable files.

Environment Variables:
<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Variable</td>
   <td>Example</td>
   <td>Purpose</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>PUBLIC_API_HOST</td>
   <td>localhost:8080</td>
   <td>The location of the API server, without the protocol.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
