**Team 5 Sprint 2 Retrospective**  
**Pleiades**  
Cate Harrison, John Kim, Henry Rovnyak, Ethan Dawes

**What went well?**

- All user stories for this sprint’s main focus, tasks, went smoothly and were completed on time.  
- Integration of frontend components and the realtime websocket backend was easy, thanks to all necessary features already being present.  
- Using a consistent format for the UI helped save time with similar user stories.  
- Some user stories that depended on each other were coordinated well between groupmated and completed successfully.  
- CI/CD was helpful in testing code in production.  
- Practicing presentation in advance and discovering a bug.

**What did not go well?**

- There was some confusion on how dates/time should be handled or displayed across components.  
- Some items were left until the final week, causing a lot of work time at once.  
- Didn’t have time to create automated tests for the new features in this sprint.  
- Didn’t have time to conduct user studies of UI/UX.  
- Discovered bug 30 min before presentation.

**How can we improve?**

- Identify features that span across multiple user stories (like handling timezones) ahead of time and decide on a consistent method before implementation.  
- Be more diligent about completing appropriate amounts of work each week.  
- Keep in mind saving time for automated testing.
