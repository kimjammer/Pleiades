**Team 5 Sprint 1 Retrospective**  
**Pleiades**  
Cate Harrison, John Kim, Henry Rovnyak, Ethan Dawes

**What went well?**

- All user stories for login and registration went smoothly, and were completed well on time.  
- Networking, including both REST and Websockets endpoints went smoothly and we ran into less issues than originally expected.  
- We were able to learn the technologies and languages fairly quickly.  
- Integration of different team membersâ€™ user stories went smoothly thanks to good use of stubbing functions and predefined data types.  
- Creation of the UI went very well overall, no painful debugging or poor quality elements.

**What did not go well?**

- Henry got sick for a week and fell behind on work.  
- We wasted time trying to implement npm packages, and it was very buggy.  
- Some members took on too much and overcommitted to the work for the sprint.  
- Some user stories were phrased in a way that made completing them difficult.  
- We sometimes did not communicate changes that would cause confusing problems for other team members.

**How can we improve?**

- Be more mindful of how acceptance criteria are worded, and try to focus more on core function than bells and whistles.  
- Carefully think ahead to how much time each task will realistically take.  
- Focus on completing acceptance criteria before going above and beyond on one task.  
- Communicate changes more effectively.
