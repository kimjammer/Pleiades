## Goals
- **Fluid Experience:** We want Pleiades to be a streamlined experience that helps students to communicate and collaborate, and not get in their way.
- **Responsibility Delegation:** We want team members to know exactly what they are responsible for, and which team members are responsible for the other tasks.
- **Clear Accountability:** We want teams to be able to see how much work each member put in, and how each person is working on the group task.
- **Collaboration:** We want teams to find time to meet and collaborate, where they are able to discuss, decide, and communicate faster.
